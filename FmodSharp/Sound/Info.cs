	/// Use this structure with System::createSound when more control is needed over loading.
    /// The possible reasons to use this with System::createSound are:
	/// <li>Loading a file from memory.
	/// <li>Loading a file from within another larger (possibly wad/pak) file, by giving the loader an offset and length.
	/// <li>To create a user created / non file based sound.
	/// <li>To specify a starting subsound to seek to within a multi-sample sounds (ie FSB/DLS/SF2) when created as a stream.
	/// <li>To specify which subsounds to load for multi-sample sounds (ie FSB/DLS/SF2) so that memory is saved and only a subset is actually loaded/read from disk.
	/// <li>To specify 'piggyback' read and seek callbacks for capture of sound data as fmod reads and decodes it.  Useful for ripping decoded PCM data from sounds as they are loaded / played.
	/// <li>To specify a MIDI DLS/SF2 sample set file to load when opening a MIDI file.

    [STRUCTURE] 
    [
        [REMARKS]
        This structure is optional!  Specify 0 or NULL in System::createSound if you don't need it!
        
        Members marked with [in] mean the user sets the value before passing it to the function.
        Members marked with [out] mean FMOD sets the value to be used after the function exits.
        
        <u>Loading a file from memory.</u>
        <li>Create the sound using the FMOD_OPENMEMORY flag.
        <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'length' for the size of the memory block in bytes.
        <li>Other flags are optional.
        
        
        <u>Loading a file from within another larger (possibly wad/pak) file, by giving the loader an offset and length.</u>
        <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'fileoffset' and 'length'.
        <li>Other flags are optional.
        
        
        <u>To create a user created / non file based sound.</u>
        <li>Create the sound using the FMOD_OPENUSER flag.
        <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'defaultfrequency, 'numchannels' and 'format'.
        <li>Other flags are optional.
        
        
        <u>To specify a starting subsound to seek to and flush with, within a multi-sample stream (ie FSB/DLS/SF2).</u>
        
        <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'initialsubsound'.
        
        
        <u>To specify which subsounds to load for multi-sample sounds (ie FSB/DLS/SF2) so that memory is saved and only a subset is actually loaded/read from disk.</u>
        
        <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'inclusionlist' and 'inclusionlistnum'.
        
        
        <u>To specify 'piggyback' read and seek callbacks for capture of sound data as fmod reads and decodes it.  Useful for ripping decoded PCM data from sounds as they are loaded / played.</u>
        
        <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'pcmreadcallback' and 'pcmseekcallback'.
        
        
        <u>To specify a MIDI DLS/SF2 sample set file to load when opening a MIDI file.</u>
        
        <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'dlsname'.
        
        
        Setting the 'decodebuffersize' is for cpu intensive codecs that may be causing stuttering, not file intensive codecs (ie those from CD or netstreams) which are normally altered with System::setStreamBufferSize.  As an example of cpu intensive codecs, an mp3 file will take more cpu to decode than a PCM wav file.
        If you have a stuttering effect, then it is using more cpu than the decode buffer playback rate can keep up with.  Increasing the decode buffersize will most likely solve this problem.
