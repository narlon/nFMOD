        <br>
        There are 2 different ways to change a parameter in this architecture.<br>
        One is to use DSP::setParameter / DSP::getParameter.  This is platform independant and is dynamic, so new unknown plugins can have their parameters enumerated and used.<br>
        The other is to use DSP::showConfigDialog.  This is platform specific and requires a GUI, and will display a dialog box to configure the plugin.<br>
