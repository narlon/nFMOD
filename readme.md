nFMOD
=====

A .NET wrapper for Firelight Studio's FMOD audio library.

Originally forked from FmodSharp which is already a very thorough wrapper. Initial goals are to reduce requirements (currently .NET Framework 4.0, ideally 2.0), support FMOD x64, package for Nuget deployment, implement a more "managed"-style approach to better handle resource management concerns and provide more meaningful logging and exception handling.
