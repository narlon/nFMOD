nFMOD
=====

A .NET wrapper for Firelight Studio's FMOD audio library.

Originally forked from FmodSharp which is already a very thorough wrapper but has been dormant for years and with a lot of TODO not done. Initial goals are to reduce requirements (currently .NET Framework 4.0, ideally 2.0), update to current FmodEx version, support FMOD x64, package for Nuget deployment, implement a more "managed"-style approach to better handle resource management concerns and provide more meaningful logging and exception handling.

NOTE
----

GTK support in the FmodSharp library is dropped in this fork. If you require GTK support please look at [FmodSharp](https://gitorious.org/fmodsharp).
