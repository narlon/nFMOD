	/// Another example is a stereo sound.
	/// It will default to left = front left, right = front right.
	/// <br>
	/// <br>
	/// This is for sounds that are not 'default'.
	/// For example you might have a sound that is 6 channels but actually made up of 3 stereo pairs,

	/// <remarks>
	/// For full flexibility of speaker assignments, use Channel::setSpeakerLevels.  This functionality is cheaper, uses less memory and easier to use.
