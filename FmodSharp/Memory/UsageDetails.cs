        [DESCRIPTION]
        
        [REMARKS]
        Every public readonly FMOD class has a getMemoryInfo function which can be used to get detailed information on what memory resources are associated with the object in question. 
        On return from getMemoryInfo, each member of this structure will hold the amount of memory used for its type in bytes.<br>
        <br>
