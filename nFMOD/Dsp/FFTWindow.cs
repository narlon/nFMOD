	/// <summary>
	/// List of windowing methods used in spectrum analysis to reduce leakage / transient signals intefering with the analysis.
	/// This is a problem with analysis of continuous signals that only have a small portion of the signal sample (the fft window size).
	/// Windowing the signal with a curve or triangle tapers the sides of the fft window to help alleviate this problem.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Cyclic signals such as a sine wave that repeat their cycle in a multiple of the window size do not need windowing.
	/// I.e. If the sine wave repeats every 1024, 512, 256 etc samples and the FMOD fft window is 1024, then the signal would not need windowing.
	/// Not windowing is the same as FMOD_DSP_FFT_WINDOW_RECT, which is the default.
	/// If the cycle of the signal (ie the sine wave) is not a multiple of the window size, it will cause frequency abnormalities, so a different windowing method is needed.
